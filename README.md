# Sunset Vibes (HTML/CSS/JS Version) 🌅

A beautiful, multi-page website to upload and view sunset videos.

## How to Run
Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

## Features
- **Home**: Welcome page with a sunset theme.
- **Upload**: Select video files (simulation).
- **Gallery**: View your "uploaded" videos.

## Note
This is a **static** website demonstration.
- "Uploading" a video will save its *details* to your browser's local storage so it appears in the gallery.
- The actual video file is not uploaded to a server (since there is no backend server).
- If you refresh or clear your browser cache, the gallery might reset.
